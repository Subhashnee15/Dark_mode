Dark mode, also known as black mode, dark theme, or night mode, features light-colored text and icons on a dark-colored background. This mode is easier on the eyes in low-light conditions, aiming to enhance readability by reducing the emitted light from device screens while still maintaining suitable color contrast ratios.

By implementing dark mode, website users can switch to a more eye-friendly and resource-saving design whenever they prefer.
